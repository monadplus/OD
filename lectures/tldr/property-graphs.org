* Graph Data Models and Applications

Schema information is embedded together with data.

Schemaless: semantics are fixed by edges/nodes labels.

Allow to represent any other data model: nodes and edges are enough

Two families of graph models:
- Property Graphs
  + Not predefined semantics
  + Closed-world assumption (i.e. complete data)
  + Generate data silos
  + Algebraic operations based on graph structures
- Knowledge Graphs
  + Open-word assumptions
  + Facilitate data sharing and linking
  + Two families:
    - RDF(S)
    - Description Logics

* Property graphs

No standard

Nodes and edges labelled and may have a set of properties (key-value pairs).
Directed edges.
Multi-graphs.

Example: n_1: Person ---------------> n_2: Movie
                      e_1: acts_in
                     --------------->
                      e_2: directs
Graph operations:
- Content-based queries: get a node, get a value of a node, aggregations.
- Topological queries: graph algorithms e.g.
  + Adjacency (e.g. "find all friends of a person")
  + Reachability: find a walk between two nodes. (e.g. friend of a friend, flight connections.)
    - Label-constrained Reachability
  + Pattern Matching (graph isomorphism): given a pattern graph P and a property graph G, find all sub-graphs of G isomorphic/homomorphic to P.
    A pattern graph (bgp) is a property graph where variables can appear in place of any constant.
    Types of pattern matching:
      - Homomorphism: multiples variables in the bgp can map to the same term in the graph.
      - Isomorphism: match function must be injective (1-1 mapping).
    Both are NP-complete problems.
    Graph simulation and bi-simulation are relaxed forms and polynomial time!
  + Graph Metrics
    - Graph node order
    - min/max degree in the graph
    - length of a path
    - graph diameter
    - ...

Graphs algorithms:
  + Centrality:
    - Page Rank: PR(i) - d*Sum PR(j)/L(j). Iterative algorithm. Start by assigning same weight to all nodes.
    - Betweenness Centrality: number shortest path through the vertex / number short path
    - Closeness Centrality: inverse of distance to the other vertexs.
  + Community Detection:
    - Triangle Counting: 3-clique
    - Louvain Method: complex algorithm, see wikipedia.
    - Strongly Connected Components: maximal set of connected components (there is a path for each pair of nodes).
  + Similarity:
    - Node Similarity: Jaccard Metric J(A,B) = |A && B| `div` |A U B|
  + Path Finding Algorithm:
    - MST
    - Dijkstra's Shortest Path

* Graph Query Languages

Query graph by (extended) pattern matching.
Semantics depend on graph database (i.e. homo vs. iso)
Distinguish between:
- Adjacency queries
- Mix of pattern matching and reachability. Extends pattern matching with regex.
  Regular path queries (RPQ)/Navigational graph patterns (NGP)
- Complex graph patterns

Cypher:
- created by neo4j
- standard de facto
- Semantics: no repeated-edge isomorphism

* Graph Databases

A graph database:
- Store and persist graphs
- Process

For example, neo4j allows to store and process graph data.

Implementations:
- Adjacency List (dense)
- Incidence List: nodes contains list of edges incident to the node.
- Adjacency Matrix (sparse)
- Incidence Matrix

Neo4j implementation(linked list)
- Nodes:
  + One file for all nodes (in memory)
  + 9 bytes per node
    - 1: metadata
    - 2-5: id first relationship
    - 6-9: id first property
  + Lookup O(1)
- Relationships:
  + One file
  + Fixed size record 32 bytes
    - Metadata
    - id starting node
    - id end node
    - id type
    - ids of the previous and following relationships of the starting/ending node
    - id first property
- Properties:
  + One file
  + Fixed size record 21 bytes
    - Metadata (belongs to edge or node)
    - id node/edge
    - ids of the previous/following properties of the node/edge
    - id property name
    - id property value
- Property name-value dict:
  + One file
